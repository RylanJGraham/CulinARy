# CulinARy

## App Description
CulinARy is an Augmented Reality application destined for the restaurant business so the clients can take a look at the menu in 3D. With this app, once a card is scanned various pop-ups will appear and the user will be able to see the dishes that they may want to consume in the establishment.

## App Goals
- Enhance the experiences in restaurants
- Make the waiting time entertaining for everyone
- Engage the customer into returning to the restaurant

## How to open the Unity project
- Clone the GitHub repository into your computer by using GitHub Desktop application.
- Install **Unity Engine** in its **2022.3.3f1 version**.
- Download & Install the **Android Build Platform** to the 2022.3.3f1 Unity install.
- Download & Install [Git LFS (Large File System)](https://git-lfs.com/) into your local computer.
- Once Git LFS is installed, open your command line (cmd) and run the following commands:
  
     > cd _(RepositoryPath)_
     
     > git lfs install

Once you've done all the previous steps, you should be ready to open the Unity project with the 2022.3.3f1 version!

## How to test the CulinARy app
To test the app, you will first need to:
1. Follow all the previous steps from the **_"How to open the Unity project"_** section above.
2. Own an **Android device**.
3. Have a USB cable to connect your device to the computer.

Once you have all the necessary material, you need to carefully follow these steps:
- Download the **Unity Remote 5** application on your device (you can find it on the Google Play Store).
- **Enable developer mode** on your device, as well as the **"USB Debugging"** checkbox (if you don't know how to, you can easily look for your exact device model).
- Setup the USB connection between the target device and your computer.
- Open Editor settings (menu: **Edit > Project Settings > Editor**). In the Unity Remote section, set **_Device_** field to the device you want to use (normally _Any Android Device_).
- In the Editor, click the **Play** button to see the application appear on the target device and in the Game View.

Now you are ready to try the app by yourself with your own Android device! If you have more doubts about the Setup process, you can check [this documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote5.html) and watch [this video](https://youtu.be/iCXwaehzRFQ?si=iEYqz2QH0_4UBKgE).
